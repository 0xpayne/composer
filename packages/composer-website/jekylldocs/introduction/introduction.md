# Welcome to Fabric Composer

---

You can use Fabric Composer to easily deploy a blockchain; defining business networks, creating and tracking assets and performing transactions. Business networks are structures made up of participants, assets, and the transactions that can be performed with them. Assets can be tangible or intangible goods, services, or property, and are stored in registries. Transactions are operations which may transform, create, and transfer assets or participants. Participants can interact with multiple business networks and maintain assets as they move between them.

Applications can be created to consume the data from business networks, quickly focusing the integration and visual aspect of projects. Fabric Composer offers code generators, allowing you to quickly generate starter applications that interact with a deployed business network. Business networks can also be integrated with existing systems to create assets, transactions, and participants based on existing data.

For an example of a business network in action; a car dealership may have a business network containing cars and auctions as assets. Participants could include buyers and auctioneers. Transactions might include bidding and creating and closing auctions. Participants can have their access to transactions restricted based on their role as either a customer or an auctioneer. The auctioneer may want to create an application to present bidding participants with a simple user interface for viewing open auctions and placing bids. This business network could also be integrated with the existing stock or inventory system for the car dealership, allowing for the addition of new stock as assets. Relevant other parties can be registered as participants whilst maintaining their own business network, for example a vehicle licensing agency might interact with an auction winner to transfer ownership of the car.

Fabric Composer requires and exploits the existing [Hyperledger Fabric blockchain](https://hyperledger.org) technology, using the blockchain consensus protocol to ensure that transactions are validated by business network participants.
