Defining a business network is the entry point to any {{site.data.conrefs.fabric_composer_full}} project. The business network contains participants, assets, and transactions. This tutorial walks you through the basics of defining a business network of your own, the contents of a business network, and how they come together to form a business network archive.

## Let's get started

1. Open the [{{site.data.conrefs.composer_short}} Playground](http://fabric-composer-next.mybluemix.net/editor). On the left are three files, a script file, `lib/logic.js` which represents transaction logic, a model file, `lib/org.acme.biznet.cto` which defines the participants assets and transactions of the business network, and an access control file, `permissions.acl` which defines the access different participants have.

2. To get set up with a sample business network click **Import/Replace**. Then click **Authenticate with GitHub** .
