# Fabric Composer API
Fabric Composer  is an application development framework for building blockchain applications based on Hyperledger. This is the API JSDoc for the Fabric Composer Client, Admin and Runtime Javascript APIs.

## Overview
The major components of Fabric Composer are:

1. The Concerto language for describing the structure of resources (assets, participants
and transactions) that participate in a blockchain-mediated business network.
2. Javascript APIs to query, create, update and delete resources and submit transactions
 from client applications. Fabric Composer  resources are stored on the blockchain.
3. Javascript transaction processor functions that runs on Hyperledger when transactions are
submitted for processing. These functions may update the state of resources
stored on the blockchain via server-side Fabric Composer APIs.
4. The Composer utility and tools to interactively test Fabric Composer based
solutions.
