        </h2>
        
            <div class="class-description"><p>This class creates an administration connection to a Hyperledger Composer runtime. The<br>connection can then be used to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Deploy BusinessNetworkDefinitions</li>
<li>Undeploy BusinessNetworkDefinitions</li>
<li>Update BusinessNetworkDefinitions</li>
<li>Send a ping message to the runtime to ensure it is running and correctly configured.</li>
<li>Store a connection profile document in the connection profile store</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: that the methods on this class take the 'businessNetworkIdentifier'; this has to match<br>the name given on the create call. An AdminConnection that has been connected to network-A can<br>only be used to adminster network-A.</p>
<p>Instances of AdminConnections can be reused for different networks. Call <code>disconnect(..)</code> then <code>connect(..)</code>.<br>Calling an api after disconnect and before connect will give an error.</p></div>
